    <h1> Mariah Brown's Biography</h1>
       
       
        <p>
        Ever since my first statistics class in middle school, I have had an interest in statistics applied to real-world settings. <br> In highschool, I used my novice analytical skills to 
        help my school in multiple philanthropic activities and events such as an annual art auction where I individually organized the event to raise money for communities in need. In two years, the auctions
        raised over <strong>$4000</strong>! I am now majoring in Business Analytics with a minor in Innovation, Design, and Startups.  In the future, I plan on working with tech, fintech, or creative-tech startups.

    <h3> Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
        Outside of school, I make music (production, beats, & composition). I plan on officially releasing my first project this year. <br> What's rare about me is that I lived in North Macedonia for four years and went to eleven primary schools.
         Additionally, I'm quite fluent in German! I like learning about other cultures and travelling.
