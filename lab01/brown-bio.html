        I am majoring in Business Analytics with a minor in Innovation, Design, and Startups. Ever since middle school, I have had an interest in statistics applied to real-world settings. In the future, I plan on working with tech startups. 
        My accomplishments:
        -	Dean's List (3x)
        -	Semper Fidelis Scholar, Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation
        -	Up and Coming Award, Blackstone Launchpad Pitch Competition Winner
        -	Peer Mentor, Whitman School of Management 
        Outside of school, I make music (production, beats, & composition). I plan on officially releasing my first project this year. What's rare about me is that I lived in North Macedonia for four years and went to eleven primary schools.
         Additionally, I'm quite fluent in German! I like learning about other cultures and travelling. 
         This past summer, I spent three months in Cambridge, U.K. I learned things about the area and was able to perform my music at an open mic in London.
