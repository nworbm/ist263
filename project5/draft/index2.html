                    I am a student studying Business Analytics and Innovation, Design, and Startups. <br>
                    I am attending Syracuse University, Whitman J School of Management, where I will graduate in 2026. <br>
                    I have varying interests from startup development to music production, as well as creative innovation, analytics, <br>
                    and sustainability

                    Outside of school, I make music (production, beats, & composition). I plan on officially releasing my first project this year. <br> What's rare about me is that I lived in North Macedonia for four years and went to eleven primary schools.
                    Additionally, I'm quite fluent in German! I like learning about other cultures and travelling.
